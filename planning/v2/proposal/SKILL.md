  Create one clear, granular, behavior-first product proposal from the product idea
  established in the current conversation context.
argument-hint: "Describe the product idea, intended users, problem, or desired outcome."
---

Create a proposal from the product idea already established in the current conversation context.

The proposal will be consumed by users, developers, planners, architects, and AI agents, so write it as a clear upstream product specification that can be used as shared context for later planning and implementation.

Focus primarily on end-to-end behavioral specifications and the experience that should be realized in the application.

Describe the product in terms of what actors do, what the system does in response, what state changes occur, what information is visible, and how the experience behaves from beginning to end.

The proposal should describe:

- the product intent
- the main problem being solved
- the expected outcome
- the primary actors
- the complete user journey from start to finish
- what users should be able to do
- what the system should do in response
- how the system should behave during normal flows
- how the system should behave when information is incomplete
- how the system should behave when something fails
- how users recover from failures or incomplete progress
- important application states visible to the user
- important transitions between those states
- interactions between different parts of the experience
- validation behavior
- review and correction behavior
- publishing or finalization behavior when applicable
- update and revision behavior after something has already been created or published
- differences between factual, estimated, inferred, generated, simulated, or unknown information when relevant
- privacy, safety, integrity, or trust-related behavior when relevant
- desktop, mobile, degraded-performance, offline, slow-network, or interrupted-session behavior when relevant
- optional capabilities without making them mandatory for the core experience
- the main successful end-to-end scenario
- the main failure and recovery scenarios
- the behavioral principles that should remain true across the entire product
- the final experience the product should create for each important actor
- a clear final definition of what success means for the product

When the idea includes AI, automation, reconstruction, generation, inference, or intelligent assistance, describe the expected observable behavior of those capabilities without prescribing how they must technically be implemented.

For AI-assisted behavior, specify:

- what context the AI should understand
- what actions the AI may perform
- when the AI should act versus only answer
- how uncertainty should be communicated
- how incorrect AI-generated information can be reviewed or corrected
- how generated or simulated information must remain distinguishable from factual information
- what the AI must not invent when source information is unavailable

When the product involves creation, capture, upload, processing, transformation, analysis, or generation, describe the full lifecycle, including:

input
→ validation
→ feedback
→ processing
→ intermediate state
→ completion
→ review
→ correction
→ finalization
→ later update

Do not limit the proposal to happy paths. Include meaningful recovery behavior for partial success, invalid input, interrupted progress, missing information, processing failures, conflicting information, and unsupported conditions.

Reconcile the full conversation before writing.

Inventory every product decision already established in the conversation, including agreed scope, constraints, compatibility boundaries, deferred items, and explicitly rejected alternatives. If the workspace contains discussion transcripts, decision logs, or other product sources referenced by the conversation, reconcile them as well. Resolve contradictions before writing; do not let the proposal reflect only the initial idea while later decisions remain only in chat. If a material decision is missing, contradictory, or unclear, pause and clarify rather than guessing.

Frame the work type without prescribing implementation.

Identify whether the request is new behavior, an enhancement or change to existing behavior, a defect fix, a porting or parity or migration effort, or another development task. For changes to existing behavior, capture current versus desired behavior and what must remain unchanged. For porting or parity work, capture the oracle or compatibility scope, what must remain compatible, and what is explicitly deferred or excluded. For defects, capture the observable failure, the expected behavior, and which unrelated behavior must be preserved. Keep this framing behavioral; do not turn it into architecture, phases, or tasks.

Make scope decisions explicit.

Distinguish in-scope behavior, non-goals, explicitly deferred behavior, and unknown items needing a decision. Deferred behavior is neither in-scope nor a non-goal: record its boundary, the reason for deferral, and what happens next. Unknown items must not be silently treated as in-scope or out-of-scope. Non-goals never become capabilities.

Write each capability as a verifiable contract.

Give every capability an observable trigger, an actor-visible outcome, a clear boundary, and relevant failure handling. Do not write umbrella capabilities that hide several independently verifiable outcomes behind one heading. Avoid untestable adjectives such as fast, seamless, robust, full, efficient, or gracefully unless the same sentence or capability states the observable test that decides pass or fail.

Use concrete examples of user-facing states, messages, flows, and interactions when they make the intended behavior easier to understand.

Prefer behavioral statements such as:

- "The user should be able to..."
- "The system should..."
- "When X happens, the system should..."
- "If the system cannot determine X confidently, it should..."
- "The user should remain able to..."
- "The system must distinguish between..."

Avoid implementation-oriented requirements such as:

- programming languages
- frameworks
- databases
- cloud providers
- infrastructure topology
- package structure
- source-code architecture
- API schemas
- internal interfaces
- specific algorithms
- specific models
- specific libraries
- deployment strategy

Do not prescribe technical decisions unless the product idea explicitly requires a particular technology as part of the actual user-facing product.

Do not create an implementation roadmap.

Do not divide the proposal into implementation phases.

Do not provide task breakdowns, milestones, sprints, coding instructions, package structures, or engineering execution plans.

Do not prematurely convert product behaviors into technical architecture.

Keep technical decisions intentionally open so downstream developers and AI agents can determine the appropriate implementation based on the codebase, constraints, available technology, and future planning.

The proposal should be sufficiently detailed that another user, developer, architect, planner, or AI agent who has never seen the original conversation can understand:

1. what product should exist,
2. who uses it,
3. how it behaves end to end,
4. what users experience in normal and failure conditions,
5. which behaviors are mandatory,
6. which capabilities are optional,
7. what information is authoritative,
8. how users remain in control,
9. and what successful completion looks like.

Organize the proposal with clear headings and logical sections.

Use concise diagrams, state flows, or example interactions when they materially improve understanding.

Do not add unrelated features, speculative requirements, or unnecessary complexity beyond the product idea already established in the conversation.

Preserve the original product intent exactly while making implicit behavioral requirements explicit.

Run a proposal self-check before finalizing.

Confirm every inventoried conversation decision appears in the proposal or is explicitly recorded as deferred, non-goal, or unknown; every capability is falsifiable from actor-visible behavior; every journey step, state, interaction, and recovery path has corresponding capability detail; no deferred or unknown item was silently dropped; no diagram introduces behavior absent from the prose; and no implementation prescription slipped in beyond an explicitly required product technology.

The resulting document should function as a durable upstream behavioral specification that downstream agents can later use to derive architecture, plans, technical specifications, tests, and implementation decisions.
